Ever gone to a career fair or a conference and had to type in your information repetitively in iPads? With IdentiFi, each attendee will submit a web registration form and have their data mapped to an rfid tag that can scan at each
                            recruiter station and give them the appropriate information needed for applications! The rfid tags also come with authentication functionality to let users into certain areas, and can be easily reprovisioned with the tags stored
                            on the cloud to allow easy reuse within events.

A Vue.js and Firebase project interfacing with an Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pi to scan RFID tags and transfer data and information for easy attendee management at conferences and career fairs!<br></p>
